# Approach to find if two Strings are anagrams

1. Pass two Strings str1 and str2 to method isAnagram()
2. If length of str1 and atr2 are not same, then they are not anagrams
3. Create an array named count of 256 length
4. Iterate over first string str1
5. In each iteration, increment the count of first String str1 and decrement teh count of second String str2
6. If count of any character is not O at the end, it means two Strings are not anagrams
